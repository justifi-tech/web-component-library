- Updated list components by abstracting filter menus to their own components which can be rendered optionally alongside their respective list components. Allowing more customization and flexibility when it comes to implementing list components by allowing independent placement of filter menus.

 - `justifi-terminals-list` can now be rendered with `justifi-terminals-list-filters`
