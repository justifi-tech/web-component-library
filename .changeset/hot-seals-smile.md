feat(UFC): Apple Pay support

- Apple Pay now appears as a payment option in the Unified Fintech Checkout when supported and enabled.
- The Apple Pay button is shown only on eligible devices/browsers; otherwise it wonâ€™t render.
- No changes required to existing UFC integrations; other payment methods are unaffected.
