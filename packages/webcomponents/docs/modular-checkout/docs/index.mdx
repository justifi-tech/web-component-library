Document every Modular Checkout building block the same way so product, design,
and engineering teams can stay in sync. The guidance below applies to the parent
shell plus each entry in [`Sub-components`](../sub-components/index).

## How component docs are structured

Every page follows the same scaffolding:

1. **Overview** – when to use the component.
2. **Usage** – minimal markup plus contextual variants.
3. **Props & Events** – rendered via `<PropsTable>` for consistency.
4. **Theming & Parts** – CSS custom properties and enumerated `::part` selectors (via `<PartsTable>`).
5. **Accessibility** – focus management, aria attributes, localization guidance.
6. **Static Examples** – non-interactive snippets that mirror Storybook stories.

## Authoring checklist

- Duplicate `../../templates/component-template.mdx` and adjust the frontmatter
  `id` plus title to match the new slug.
- Keep prose declarative and actionable—no conversational filler.
- Include at least one `<UsageSnippet>`, `<PropsTable>`, and `<PartsTable>` block.
- Reference shared guides when overlapping content would otherwise drift.
- Document `::part` styling hooks plus any CSS variables the component exposes.
- Add cross-links back to [`Modular Checkout`](../index) and any related
  components so readers can navigate without scrolling the sidebar.
