description: Orientation hub for the JustiFi modular checkout experience.

Modular Checkout stitches every payment surface, summary view, and auxiliary
experience into one cohesive flow. Use this hub to jump into the right phase of
the journey:

- [Introduction](./introduction/index) for architecture, props, events, and
  theming guidance.
- [Docs](./docs/index) when you are authoring or updating technical reference
  material for new sub-components.
- [Complete Examples](./complete-examples/index) for Storybook layouts that
  demonstrate multi-step funnels.
- [Sub-components](./sub-components/index) for deep dives on each child element
  (card form, bank form, payment method picker, etc.).

> Ship custom layouts fast: combine `[sub-components](./sub-components/index)`
> with the patterns in `[Example](./example/index)` so you can validate UX
> decisions before plumbing real data.
