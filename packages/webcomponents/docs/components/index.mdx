Browse individual component pages for deep dives on props, events, slot contracts, `::part` selectors, and integration caveats.

## How component docs are structured

Every page follows the same scaffolding:

1. **Overview** – when to use the component.
2. **Usage** – minimal markup plus contextual variants.
3. **Props & Events** – rendered via `<PropsTable>` for consistency.
4. **Theming & Parts** – CSS custom properties and enumerated `::part` selectors (via `<PartsTable>`).
5. **Accessibility** – focus management, aria attributes, localization guidance.
6. **Static Examples** – non-interactive snippets that mirror Storybook stories.

## Authoring checklist

- Duplicate `../templates/component-template.mdx` and adjust the frontmatter ID + sidebar position.
- Keep prose declarative and actionable—no conversational filler.
- Include at least one `<UsageSnippet>`, `<PropsTable>`, and `<PartsTable>` block.
- Reference shared guides when overlapping content would otherwise drift.
- Document `::part` styling hooks plus any CSS variables the component exposes.
