## Overview

`<justifi-payment-details>` lets support teams inspect an individual payment: statuses, amounts, funding timelines, and actions such as refunds or dispute escalations. Embed it within your console or CRM so operators avoid switching to Storybook or internal tools.

## Usage

<UsageSnippet
  title="Payment drill-down"
  description="Load by passing the payment identifier and the account context."
  code={`<justifi-payment-details
  account-id="acc_123"
  auth-token="wct_reporting"
  payment-id="pay_456"
/>`}
  language="html"
/>

## Props, Events & Methods

<PropsTable
  rows={[
    {
      name: 'account-id',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      description: 'Owning platform account for authorization.',
    },
    {
      name: 'auth-token',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      description: 'Token with `read:payments` scope.',
    },
    {
      name: 'payment-id',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      description: 'Payment to display.',
    },
    {
      name: 'show-actions',
      type: 'boolean',
      defaultValue: 'true',
      description: 'Hide when you only need a read-only audit surface.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Events

- `refund-requested`: emitted when an operator clicks the refund CTA.
- `dispute-opened`: indicates that the “Open dispute” action was invoked.

### Public methods

1. `refresh()` – Re-fetch the payment to reflect new statuses after an action.

## Theming & Layout

- Apply typography and surface overrides using CSS properties such as `--justifi-card-surface`, `--justifi-card-border`, and `--justifi-card-spacing`.
- Keep the container at a medium width (480–720px) for optimal readability; the layout collapses gracefully on mobile by stacking metadata under the summary card.

<PartsTable
  parts={[
    { name: 'header', description: 'Payment summary banner with amount, status, and customer info.' },
    { name: 'timeline', description: 'List of events (authorized, captured, refunded); style connecting lines here.' },
    { name: 'actions', description: 'Wrapper for refund/dispute call-to-action buttons.' },
  ]}
/>

## Accessibility

- Timeline events use semantic lists and include `aria-label` descriptions for statuses.
- Action buttons expose full text labels instead of icon-only affordances.
- Focus is preserved after running actions so operators remain in context.

## Static examples

<UsageSnippet
  title="Hook into refund events"
  code={`const details = document.querySelector('justifi-payment-details');

details.addEventListener('refund-requested', ({ detail }) => {
  console.log('Starting refund flow for payment', detail.payment_id);
});`}
  language="js"
/>
