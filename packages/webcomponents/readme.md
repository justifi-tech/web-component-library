<h1 align="center">JustiFi Web Components</h1>

The JustiFi web component library is an ever-expanding repository of customizable, white-labeled fintech components. From Payment Forms and Tables/Lists to Charts and Onboarding Forms, this diverse collection is designed to empower our clients to seamlessly integrate crucial elements of their financial infrastructure into existing dashboards and software solutions.


## Installation

The best method for including the JustiFi web components in your application is via npm:

`npm install @justifi/webcomponents`


## TypeScript Types

TypeScript types are included with the webcomponents package. For applications that only need type definitions without the components, types can also be imported directly from `@justifi/types`:

```typescript
import { IPayment, PaymentStatuses, Business } from '@justifi/types';
```

See the [@justifi/types README](../types/README.md) for more details on available exports.
