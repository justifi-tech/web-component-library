## Usage

There are two methods for including the JustiFi web components in your application:

### Installation via npm

`npm install @justifi/webcomponents`

### Include from CDN

Add the script tag in the `head` of your `index.html`:
```
<script type='module' src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@justifi/webcomponents@4.7.1-rc.0/dist/webcomponents/webcomponents.esm.js'></script>
```
Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc.
