# Plaid Integration Implementation Plan

## Epic Overview

**Epic**: Add Plaid as a payment method option to the Checkout  
**Timeline**: 5 working days  
**Objective**: Enable customers to securely pay using their bank accounts through Plaid's authentication flow

## Background

The current checkout system supports multiple payment methods including credit cards, bank accounts, and BNPL (Sezzle). Adding Plaid integration will provide customers with a more secure and user-friendly way to connect their bank accounts, leveraging Plaid's industry-standard security and compliance standards.

## User Flow

1. User selects "Pay with Bank Account (Plaid)" option
2. Plaid Link modal opens for bank authentication
3. User selects and authenticates with their bank
4. Plaid returns public token to the component
5. Component stores token for use during checkout submission
6. User clicks "Pay" button to complete checkout
7. Backend tokenizes the bank account using the public token

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Constraints

- Must be a standalone sub-component that can be slotted into `justifi-modular-checkout`
- Must follow the existing payment method component patterns (similar to `justifi-sezzle-payment-method`)
- Must integrate with the existing checkout store and validation system
- Must support the existing "save payment method" functionality

### Technical Specifications

- **SDK**: Plaid Link v2 (latest stable version)
- **Environment Support**: Both sandbox and production
- **Account Types**: Checking and savings accounts
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (ES6+ support)
- **Framework**: Stencil.js web components (no React dependencies)

### Integration Points

- **Frontend**: Plaid Link SDK for bank authentication
- **Backend**: Existing `/plaid/:account_id/link` and `/plaid/:account_id/tokenize` endpoints
- **State Management**: Integration with existing `checkoutStore`
- **Validation**: Integration with existing modular checkout validation system

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Structure

```typescript
@Component({
  tag: 'justifi-plaid-payment-method',
  shadow: true
})
export class PlaidPaymentMethod {
  @State() isAuthenticating: boolean = false;
  @State() publicToken: string | null = null;
  @State() linkToken: string | null = null;
  @State() error: string | null = null;

  @Event({ bubbles: true }) paymentMethodOptionSelected: EventEmitter;
  @Event({ bubbles: true }) plaidError: EventEmitter;

  @Method()
  async resolvePaymentMethod(): Promise<PaymentMethodPayload>;

  @Method()
  async validate(): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

### Key Methods

- `initializePlaidLink()`: Sets up Plaid Link with link token
- `handlePlaidSuccess()`: Processes successful bank authentication
- `handlePlaidError()`: Handles authentication errors
- `resolvePaymentMethod()`: Returns payment method data for checkout
- `validate()`: Validates component state for checkout submission

### State Management

- Component maintains its own state for Plaid-specific data
- Integrates with existing `checkoutStore` for payment method selection
- Emits events for parent component communication
- Handles cleanup and state reset appropriately

## Error Handling

### Error Messages

- **Network Errors**: "Unable to connect to Plaid. Please try again."
- **Authentication Failures**: "Bank authentication failed. Please try again."
- **Token Expiration**: "Your bank session has expired. Please reconnect your account."
- **Unsupported Banks**: "Your bank is not currently supported. Please try a different payment method."

### Error Scenarios

1. Plaid Link fails to load
2. User cancels authentication
3. Authentication times out
4. Bank returns error
5. Network connectivity issues
6. Token expiration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Component initialization and lifecycle
- Plaid Link integration
- State management
- Error handling
- Validation logic
- Event emission

### Integration Tests

- Integration with modular checkout
- Payment method selection
- Validation system integration
- Error event handling
- State synchronization

### Manual QA Tests

- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Error scenario handling
- User experience flow
- Performance testing

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- Plaid Link SDK (latest stable version)
- Plaid backend endpoints (already implemented)
- Modern browser support for ES6+ features

### Internal Dependencies

- Existing modular checkout system
- Checkout store and state management
- Existing payment method components
- Existing API service patterns and utilities
- Testing framework and utilities

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Plaid SDK Compatibility**: Risk of SDK version conflicts or breaking changes

   - Mitigation: Use stable, well-tested SDK version with fallback options

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Risk of Plaid Link not working in all target browsers

   - Mitigation: Test across major browsers and implement graceful degradation

3. **Performance Impact**: Risk of Plaid integration slowing down checkout
   - Mitigation: Lazy load Plaid SDK and optimize initialization

### Business Risks

1. **User Experience**: Risk of complex authentication flow confusing users

   - Mitigation: Clear messaging and intuitive error handling

2. **Integration Complexity**: Risk of breaking existing checkout functionality
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and gradual rollout
