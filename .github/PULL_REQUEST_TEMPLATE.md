<!--
Describe the rationale and use case for this pull request.  Provide any
background, examples, and images that provide further information to accurately
describe what it is that you are adding to the repo.  Add subsections as
necessary to organize and feel free to link and reference other PRs as
necessary, but also include them in the links section below as a quick
reference.

Keep code changes as short as possible and implementing a single feature/fix/refactoring, when possible
-->

Developer To Dos
--------------

* Increment the version number for relevant packages
  - [ ] This is a new MAJOR version (incompatible API changes were made)
  - [ ] This is a new MINOR version (functionality was added in a backwards compatible manner)
  - [ ] This is a new PATCH version (backwards compatible bug fixes)
* Update the CHANGELOG.md with a summary of the changes
  - If this is a MAJOR version, what are the breaking API changes? Was anything added to the API?
  - If this is a MINOR version, what feature was added? Why would consumers want this new version?
  - If this is a PATCH version, what was fixed?
* Update the appropriate documentation. Keep in mind that this mono repository has README files at the repository, project, and component levels. We want developers to be able to find what they need from the main README, so make sure to add links to component documentation if adding something new.

Steps for Testing/QA
--------------------

<!--
If minor-moderate changes are made on endpoints covered by integration tests,
automated QA should provide sufficient test coverage. Check the test reports
[here](https://justifi-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGINEERIN/pages/35782659/Test+Reports)
to see if your changes are covered. If implementing new features/endpoints or if
changes are interacting with a third-party service, most likely manual QA will be desired.

If there are any manual steps that you would like the reviewer(s) to take to
verify your changes, please describe in detail the steps to reproduce the
features added by the pull request, or the bug before and after the change.
