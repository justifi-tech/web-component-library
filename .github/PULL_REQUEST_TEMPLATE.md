**Guidelines:**

* Keep Pull Request titles short and to the point, ideally under 72 characters
* Provide as much context/info in the description as necessary to get the
  reviewer up to the same domain knowledge level as yourself
* Keep code changes as short as possible and implementing a single
  feature/fix/refactoring, when possible

Steps for Testing/QA
--------------------

<!--
If minor-moderate changes are made on endpoints covered by integration tests,
automated QA should provide sufficient test coverage. Check the test reports
[here](https://justifi-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGINEERIN/pages/35782659/Test+Reports)
to see if your changes are covered. If implementing new features/endpoints or if
changes are interacting with a third-party service, most likely manual QA will be desired.

If there are any manual steps that you would like the reviewer(s) to take to
verify your changes, please describe in detail the steps to reproduce the
features added by the pull request, or the bug before and after the change.
