## General Guidelines

- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and to the point and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- Do not run build, dev, start, lint, format, clean, or any other commands. Just answer the question or task.
- You're allowed to run test related commands only locally. The allowed commands are only `test` and `test:e2e`
