# SSN Field Bug Analysis and Fix

## Bug Description

When entering a Social Security Number (SSN) in the representative form with dashes (e.g., `345-54-6622`), the form appears to submit successfully but the SSN value is not saved. The API response shows an empty value for `ssn_last4: ""`.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is located in the `form-control-number-masked.tsx` component, which is used for SSN input fields. The component has conflicting event handlers that send different values to the form validation:

### Technical Details

1. **IMask Setup**: The component uses IMask library with `SSN_MASK = '000-00-0000'` to provide visual formatting
2. **Expected Behavior**: IMask should extract unmasked values (digits only) for form processing
3. **Actual Issue**: Two different event handlers were sending inconsistent values:
   - `initializeIMask()` correctly sends unmasked value via `this.imask?.unmaskedValue` 
   - `handleFormControlInput()` incorrectly sends masked value via `target.value` (includes dashes)

### Validation Mismatch

The form validation expects digits only via the regex pattern:
```typescript
export const ssnRegex = /^(?!000|666|9\d{2})\d{3}(?!00)\d{2}(?!0000)\d{4}$/;
```

When the masked value (with dashes) is sent to validation, it fails the regex check and gets processed as an invalid/empty value.

## Files Affected

- `packages/webcomponents/src/ui-components/form/form-control-number-masked.tsx`
- `packages/webcomponents/src/ui-components/form/test/form-control-number-masked.spec.tsx`

## Fix Implementation

### Code Changes

**File**: `packages/webcomponents/src/ui-components/form/form-control-number-masked.tsx`

```typescript
handleFormControlInput = (event: any) => {
  const target = event.target;
  const name = target.getAttribute('name');
  // Fix: Use unmasked value instead of target.value to ensure consistency
  const rawValue = this.imask?.unmaskedValue || target.value;
  this.formControlInput.emit({ name: name, value: rawValue });
}
```

**Before**: `this.formControlInput.emit({ name: name, value: target.value });`
**After**: Uses `this.imask?.unmaskedValue` with fallback to `target.value`

### Testing Changes

Added comprehensive test case to verify SSN masking behavior:

```typescript
it('Emits unmasked value for SSN mask input', async () => {
  // Test verifies that form events emit unmasked values for proper validation
});
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **User Input**: User enters `345-54-6622` in SSN field
2. **Visual Display**: Field shows formatted value with dashes: `345-54-6622`
3. **Form Processing**: Form validation receives unmasked value: `345546622`
4. **Validation**: Value passes SSN regex validation
5. **API Submission**: SSN is successfully saved and `ssn_last4` shows last 4 digits

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Load the business representative form
2. Enter an SSN with dashes: `123-45-6789`
3. Submit the form
4. Check the API response in developer tools
5. Verify `ssn_last4` field contains `"6789"` instead of empty string
6. Verify the business record shows the SSN was saved

### Automated Testing

The fix includes a new test case that verifies:
- Form events emit unmasked values
- Input handling maintains consistency between visual display and form processing
- Fallback behavior works when IMask is not available

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Empty Input**: Ensure empty SSN fields are handled correctly
2. **Partial Input**: Test behavior with incomplete SSN entries
3. **Invalid Formats**: Verify proper validation error messages
4. **Copy/Paste**: Test pasting SSN values with and without dashes
5. **Form Resubmission**: Ensure subsequent form submissions work correctly

## Related Components

This fix may benefit other components that use `form-control-number-masked`:
- Owner form SSN input
- Phone number inputs
- Tax ID inputs

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Ensure consistent value handling between visual formatting and form processing
2. Add comprehensive tests for masked input components
3. Document expected behavior for form validation vs. display formatting
4. Consider centralizing mask handling logic for consistency
