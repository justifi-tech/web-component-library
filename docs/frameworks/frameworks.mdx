Pick the framework-specific guide that matches your host app. Each page covers
bundle registration, component typing, and ergonomics for that stack.

1. [Angular](/web-components/frameworks/angular) – schemas, module setup, and DI-friendly helpers.
2. [React](/web-components/frameworks/react) – rendering custom elements from JSX plus refs/events.
3. [Vue 3](/web-components/frameworks/vue) – registering components globally or per-view with full
   TypeScript support.

> Need another framework? Duplicate `templates/guide-template.mdx`, follow the
> checklist inside, and add it to this directory so it picks up the same
> navigation pattern.
