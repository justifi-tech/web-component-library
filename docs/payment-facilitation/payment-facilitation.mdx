Build an end-to-end payment experience by combining these focused guides:

1. [Unified Fintech Checkout™](./payment-facilitation/unified-fintech-checkout™) – the
   full-stack checkout shell for authorization and capture.
2. [Tokenize Payment Method](./payment-facilitation/tokenize-payment-method) – vault cards or
   bank accounts for future use.
3. [Refund Payment](./payment-facilitation/refund-payment) – return funds with audit-friendly
   status updates.
4. [Dispute Management](./payment-facilitation/dispute-management) – monitor chargebacks and
   submit compelling evidence.

> Once your payment-facilitation configuration is live, tie it into
> `[Entities](../entities)` and `[Merchant Tools](../merchant-tools)`
> to keep back-office teams in sync.
