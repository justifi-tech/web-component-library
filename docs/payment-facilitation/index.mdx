Build an end-to-end payment experience by combining these focused guides:

1. [Unified Fintech Checkout™](./unified-fintech-checkout™/index) – the
   full-stack checkout shell for authorization and capture.
2. [Tokenize Payment Method](./tokenize-payment-method/index) – vault cards or
   bank accounts for future use.
3. [Refund Payment](./refund-payment/index) – return funds with audit-friendly
   status updates.
4. [Dispute Management](./dispute-management/index) – monitor chargebacks and
   submit compelling evidence.

> Once your payment-facilitation configuration is live, tie it into
> `[Entities](../entities/index)` and `[Merchant Tools](../merchant-tools/index)`
> to keep back-office teams in sync.
