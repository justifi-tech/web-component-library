Use the Entities toolkit to collect and maintain compliance-ready business
records.

- [BusinessDetails](./entities/business-details) – guided intake for legal and tax
  profiles.
- [Payment Provisioning](./entities/payment-provisioning) – connect verified
  businesses to the rails they need to accept funds.

> Pair these components with back-office workflows so underwriting teams can
> review submissions without bouncing between tools.
