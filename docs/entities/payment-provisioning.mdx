## Overview

Component to render a business onboarding form, segmented into multiple steps. You will need to first create a business via [Business API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Business) to get the business-id required for this component.

## Usage

<pre>
  <code className="language-html">{`<justifi-payment-provisioning
  auth-token="wct_provisioning"
  business-id="biz_456"
/>`}</code>
</pre>

## Props & Events

<PropsMarkdownTable
  props={getPropsFromDocs('justifi-payment-provisioning', docsJson)}
/>

### Events

- `submit-event`: Fires when payout information is collected and saved. Payload includes the API response or error details.
- `click-event`: Fires on button interactions (Previous/Next step navigation). Payload includes the action name.
- `error-event`: Fires when errors occur, including:
  - Missing required props (`auth-token` or `business-id`)
  - API failures during business data fetch or provisioning submission
  - When provisioning has already been requested for the business

  Payload includes `message`, `errorCode`, and `severity` properties.

### Public Methods
