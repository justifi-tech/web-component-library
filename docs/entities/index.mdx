Use the Entities toolkit to collect and maintain compliance-ready business
records.

- [BusinessDetails](./businessdetails/index) – guided intake for legal and tax
  profiles.
- [BusinessForm](./businessform/index) – configurable form shell tailored to
  your onboarding steps.
- [Payment Provisioning](./payment-provisioning/index) – connect verified
  businesses to the rails they need to accept funds.

> Pair these components with back-office workflows so underwriting teams can
> review submissions without bouncing between tools.
