Modular Checkout stitches every payment surface, summary view, and auxiliary
experience into one cohesive flow. Use this hub to jump into the right phase of
the journey:

- [Introduction](./modular-checkout/introduction) for architecture, props, events, and
  theming guidance.
- [Complete Examples](./modular-checkout/complete-examples) for Storybook layouts that
  demonstrate multi-step funnels.
- [Sub-components](./modular-checkout/sub-components) for deep dives on each child element
  (card form, bank form, payment method picker, etc.).
