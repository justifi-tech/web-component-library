title: Modular Checkout
description: Orientation hub for the JustiFi modular checkout experience.
---

Modular Checkout stitches every payment surface, summary view, and auxiliary
experience into one cohesive flow. Use this hub to jump into the right phase of
the journey:

- [Introduction](./modular-checkout/introduction) for architecture, props, events, and
  theming guidance.
- [Complete Examples](./modular-checkout/complete-examples) for Storybook layouts that
  demonstrate multi-step funnels.
- [Sub-components](./modular-checkout/sub-components) for deep dives on each child element
  (card form, bank form, payment method picker, etc.).

## Pre-filling Billing Information

Use `fillBillingForm()` to programmatically pre-populate billing fields, e.g. from saved customer data. Values persist when the user switches between payment methods.

```javascript
const modularCheckout = document.querySelector('justifi-modular-checkout');

modularCheckout.fillBillingForm({
  name: 'John Doe',
  address_line1: '123 Main St',
  address_city: 'Anytown',
  address_state: 'NY',
  address_postal_code: '12345',
});
```

All fields are optional except `address_postal_code`:

```typescript
interface BillingFormFields {
  name?: string;
  address_line1?: string;
  address_line2?: string;
  address_city?: string;
  address_state?: string;
  address_postal_code: string; // required
}
```
