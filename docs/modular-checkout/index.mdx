title: Modular Checkout
description: Orientation hub for the JustiFi modular checkout experience.
---

Modular Checkout stitches every payment surface, summary view, and auxiliary
experience into one cohesive flow. Use this hub to jump into the right phase of
the journey:

- [Introduction](./introduction/index) for architecture, props, events, and
  theming guidance.
- [Complete Examples](./complete-examples/index) for Storybook layouts that
  demonstrate multi-step funnels.
- [Sub-components](./sub-components/index) for deep dives on each child element
  (card form, bank form, payment method picker, etc.).

> Ship custom layouts fast: combine `[sub-components](./sub-components/index)`
> with the patterns in `[Example](./example/index)` so you can validate UX
> decisions before plumbing real data.
