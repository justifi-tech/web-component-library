Reference these Storybook stories when you need production-ready layout
patterns or want to hand designers a live sandbox.

- [Layout 1](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/modular-checkout-complete-examples-layout-1--docs):
  responsive two-column layout with summary pinned on desktop.
- [Layout 2](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/modular-checkout-complete-examples-layout-2--docs):
  hero-style payment rail picker plus collapsible summaries.
- [Layout 3](https://storybook.justifi.ai/?path=/docs/modular-checkout-complete-examples-layout-3--docs):
  condensed layout optimized for embedded partner portals.

> These examples map 1:1 with production code, so you can inspect the DOM,
> props, and CSS custom properties without digging through story sources.
