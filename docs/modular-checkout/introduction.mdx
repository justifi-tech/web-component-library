## Overview

The `justifi-modular-checkout` wrapper component serves as a container for checkout-related sub components. It manages the tokenization of payment methods, billing information, insurance, and overall form submission to complete the checkout. It also supports saving a payment method to a payment method group for future use.

## Usage

<pre>
  <code className="language-html">{`<justifi-modular-checkout
  account-id="acc_123"
  auth-token="wct_checkout"
  checkout-id="chk_456"
>
  <justifi-modular-checkout-card-form slot="payment-methods" />
  <justifi-modular-checkout-summary slot="summary" />
</justifi-modular-checkout>`}</code>
</pre>

## Props, Events & Methods

<PropsMarkdownTable
  props={getPropsFromDocs('justifi-modular-checkout', docsJson)}
/>

### Events

- `error-event`: Emitted when validation fails, tokenization errors occur, or any other error happens during checkout processing. The event detail includes `message`, `errorCode`, and `severity`.
- `submit-event`: Fired when checkout is successfully completed. The event detail includes the `checkout` object and a success `message`.
- `checkout-changed`: Emitted whenever the checkout state changes (e.g., payment method selection, available payment methods). The event detail includes `availablePaymentMethodTypes`, `selectedPaymentMethod`, and `savedPaymentMethods`.

### Public methods

1. `submitCheckout(submitCheckoutArgs?)` – Programmatically trigger the checkout submission. Validates forms, tokenizes payment methods if needed, and completes the checkout. Optionally accepts billing form fields as arguments.
2. `validate()` – Validates all nested forms (payment method, billing, insurance) and returns a boolean indicating if validation passed. Emits `error-event` if validation fails.
3. `setSelectedPaymentMethod(paymentMethod)` – Sets the selected payment method and payment token in the checkout store.
