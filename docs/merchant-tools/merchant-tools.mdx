Merchant Tools components expose the same operational insights that platforms
use internally. Mix and match them to build tailored portals:

1. [Checkouts List](/web-components/merchant-tools/checkouts-list) – monitor in-flight checkout
   sessions and states.
2. [Payments List](/web-components/merchant-tools/payments-list) / [Payment Details](/web-components/merchant-tools/payment-details)
   – audit every transaction from authorization through settlement.
3. [Payment Transactions List](/web-components/merchant-tools/payment-transactions-list) – deep dive
   into ledger-level events.
4. [Payouts List](/web-components/merchant-tools/payouts-list), [Payout Details](/web-components/merchant-tools/payout-details),
   and [Payout Transactions List](/web-components/merchant-tools/payout-transactions-list) – reconcile
   disbursements end to end.
5. [Gross Payments Chart](/web-components/merchant-tools/gross-payments-chart) – visualize trends.
6. [Order Terminals](/web-components/merchant-tools/order-terminals), [Terminal Orders List](/web-components/merchant-tools/terminal-orders-list),
   and [Terminals List](/web-components/merchant-tools/terminals-list) – manage hardware fulfillment.

> Most teams embed just a handful of these components per view. Keep pages
> focused so operators can answer one question without sifting through noise.
