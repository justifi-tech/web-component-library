description: Operational dashboards for tracking payouts, payments, and terminals.
---

Merchant Tools components expose the same operational insights that platforms
use internally. Mix and match them to build tailored portals:

1. [Checkouts List](./checkouts-list/index) – monitor in-flight checkout
   sessions and states.
2. [Payments List](./payments-list/index) / [Payment Details](./payment-details/index)
   – audit every transaction from authorization through settlement.
3. [Payment Transactions List](./payment-transactions-list/index) – deep dive
   into ledger-level events.
4. [Payouts List](./payouts-list/index), [Payout Details](./payout-details/index),
   and [Payout Transactions List](./payout-transactions-list/index) – reconcile
   disbursements end to end.
5. [Gross Payments Chart](./gross-payments-chart/index) – visualize trends.
6. [Order Terminals](./order-terminals/index), [Terminal Orders List](./terminal-orders-list/index),
   and [Terminals List](./terminals-list/index) – manage hardware fulfillment.

> Most teams embed just a handful of these components per view. Keep pages
> focused so operators can answer one question without sifting through noise.
