# Usage

The components can be used as HTML Web Components or as React components.

## HTML Web Components

The simplest way to use the Web Components is to include the following script within your HTML. This loads all the components into the browsers custom component registry.

<Source
  language="html"
  dark
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <script type='module' src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@justifi/webcomponents@${extractWebcomponentsVersion()}/dist/webcomponents/webcomponents.esm.js'></script>
  `}
/>

Then, you can use the custom elements as normal `HTML` tags.

<Source
  language="html"
  dark
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <justifi-payment-form attr="value" />
  `}
/>

It can also be installed as a package with `npm` or `yarn`

<Source
  language="bash"
  dark
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    npm install --save @justifi/webcomponents
  `}
/>

### Default styling

In both cases, you most likely will also want to include the `CSS` file for the components to have their default styling (that you can override).

It can be included from the CDN, which is easier to start with, but won't update as the version changes in the package installed in you `package.json`:

<Source
  language="html"
  dark
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@justifi/webcomponents@${extractWebcomponentsVersion()}/dist/webcomponents/webcomponents.css" />
  `}
/>

If you want to include it from the `node_modules` you'll need to get this file to the static directory of your built app in your pipeline:

<Source
  language="html"
  dark
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/static/assets/webcomponents.css" />
  `}
/>

## React

To use the React version of the web components, you need to install the package:

<Source
  language="bash"
  dark
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    npm install --save @justifi/react-components
  `}
/>

Then import it and use it as a normal React component, for a more in-depth explanation you can search the sidebar for the component you want to use:

<Source
  language='jsx'
  dark
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    import { JustifiCardForm } from '@justifi/react-components';

    <JustifiCardForm
      ref={cardFormRef}
      onCardFormReady={onPaymentMethodReady}
    />

`}
/>

### For a detailed explanation of how to use the React components, [See the React page](/docs/react--docs)

# Styling

## Styling components with variables

The following components need to be styled by overriding `CSS variables`, since they are scoped within an iFrame:

- [BankAccountForm](?path=/docs/components-bankaccountform--docs)
- [CardForm](?path=/docs/components-cardform--docs)
- [PaymentForm](?path=/docs/components-paymentform--docs)

This is a complete list of variables as defined in this project's `root.scss`:

<SummaryElement title="See full list of CSS variables available">
  <CSSVars />
</SummaryElement>

<Markdown>{`
  **Note:** When customizing the \`--jfi-form-control-box-shadow\` variable, ensure that the \`--jfi-layout-padding\` is not set to \`0\`. This prevents the box-shadow of the last input from being inset into the iframe container, ensuring it remains visible. Additionally, to create enough room around the inputs and prevent them from getting cut off, the layout padding should be set to at least the size of the box shadow
`}</Markdown>

## Loading Google fonts

In order to load custom fonts in the iFramed components, there's a special CSS variable that can be used: `--jfi-load-google-font`.
The value provided should be a string commpatible with what's described in the following [official documentation from Google](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2).

### Check out the [CardForm story for this to see it in action](?path=/docs/components-cardform--styled).

Usage examples:

<Source
  language="css"
  dark
  code={dedent`
    :root {
      /*
        Note: The value provided to '--jfi-load-google-font' needs to be wrapped in quotes,
        since it can contain characters incompatible with CSS that can't be used literally.

        Also, as you'll see in the examples below, if more than one font-family
        is to be loaded, any subsequent one except the first needs to be preceeded
        by the '&family=' string, as described in the documentation linked above.
      */

      /* Load a single font (and it's default weight of 400) */
      --jfi-load-google-font: 'Inter';

      /* Load a font with multiple weights */
      --jfi-load-google-font: 'Inter:wght@200;400;700;900';

      /* Load multiple fonts */
      --jfi-load-google-font: 'Inter:wght@200;400;700;900&family=Agdasima';

      /* Load multiple fonts with multiple weights */
      --jfi-load-google-font: 'Inter:wght@200;400;700;900&family=Agdasima:wght@200;400';

      /* Then, any of these can be used with the following two variables */
      --jfi-layout-font-family: Inter; /* Applies to all elements and is inherited */
      --jfi-form-label-font-family: Agdasima; /* Applies exclusively to the form labels */
    }

`}
/>

## Styling components with custom css

For every other component, you'll be able to see a list of `exportedparts` in their `Docs` page. These exported `parts` can be used in the following manner:

<Source
  language="css"
  dark
  code={dedent`
    /* Given an exportedpart of "label" for example */
    the-component-tag:part(label) {
      /* Your custom css */
    }
  `}
/>
