# Payment methods

---

The Unified Checkout automatically displays additional payment options when they are enabled in your account settings and when device/browser or other eligibility constraints are met:

- **Apple Pay**: Must be enabled in account settings. It renders automatically only on eligible devices/browsers; otherwise it will not appear.
- **Sezzle (BNPL)**: Must be enabled in account settings. It displays automatically when available for the account.
- **Plaid (Bank account verification)**: Must be enabled in account settings. It displays automatically when bank account payments with Plaid verification are enabled.

No extra component configuration is required beyond enabling these features on the account. When unavailable or ineligible, these options are simply not shown.

# Authorization

---

Web Component Token: These tokens are generated by your backend services using the [Web Component Tokens API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Web-Component-Tokens).
Each token can be scoped to perform a set number of actions and is active for 60 minutes.
When creating a web component token for this specific component you'll need to use the following roles:

<ul>
  <li>
    `write:checkout:checkout_id` - use the `checkout_id` you receive when you
    create a checkout via [Checkout
    API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts)
  </li>
  <li>
    `write:tokenize:account_id` - use the `account_id` you pass to the checkout
    API
  </li>
</ul>

# Security

---

The api endpoint associated with this component has the following security measures in place:

1. **Rate Limiting**: POST requests to are limited to 2 requests per 10 seconds.
2. **Token-based Request Limiting**: POST requests using web component token authentication are limited to 10 attempts per token.

These measures are in place to prevent abuse and ensure the security of the payment processing system.
