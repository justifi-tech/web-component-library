# Props, events and methods

<ArgTypes exclude={['Theme']} />

<h1>Authorization</h1>

<hr />

Web Component Token: These tokens are generated by your backend services using the [Web Component Tokens API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Web-Component-Tokens). 
Each token can be scoped to perform a set number of actions and is active for 60 minutes. 
When creating a web component token for this specific component you'll need to use the following roles:

<ul>
  <li>
    `write:checkout:checkout_id` - use the `checkout_id` you receive when you create a checkout via [Checkout API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Checkouts)
  </li>
  <li>
    `write:tokenize:account_id` - use the `account_id` you pass to the checkout API
  </li>
</ul>

# Security

---

The api endpoint associated with this component has the following security measures in place:

1. **Rate Limiting**: POST requests to are limited to 2 requests per 10 seconds.
2. **Token-based Request Limiting**: POST requests using web component token authentication are limited to 10 attempts per token.

These measures are in place to prevent abuse and ensure the security of the payment processing system.

**Note:** While `client-id` is still supported, we now recommend using web component tokens (`auth-token`) for enhanced security and flexibility.
