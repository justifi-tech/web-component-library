# Plaid Payment Method

Renders a radio input for selecting the Plaid bank account payment method, and orchestrates the Plaid Link flow to securely connect a bank account when selected.

This component is designed to be used within the `justifi-modular-checkout` and does not accept props directly. It relies on the shared state and context managed by `justifi-modular-checkout` (auth token, account ID, and checkout ID). Saving a new payment method is controlled via the `justifi-save-new-payment-method` checkbox when a payment method group is available.

It exposes no public properties for configuration, but does emit Plaid-specific events for error handling and recovery.

- **Events**:
  - **`plaidError`**: Emitted when a Plaid error occurs. The event detail includes a rich error payload with `code`, `message`, `severity`, and additional data such as `retryable` and `userAction`.
  - **`plaidErrorRecovered`**: Emitted when an error condition is resolved (e.g., after successful authentication).

The component automatically loads the Plaid Link SDK script and initializes the flow when selected. It handles token exchange with your backend to create a payment token for checkout completion.

> Note: This component renders nothing and logs a console warning when bank account verification is not enabled for the checkout (`payment_settings.bank_account_verification !== true`).
