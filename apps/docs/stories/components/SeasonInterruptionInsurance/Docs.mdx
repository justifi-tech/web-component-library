<ArgTypes exclude={['Theme']} />

# Authorization

---

<p>
  Authorization is performed by passing a web component token as{' '}
  <code>auth-token</code>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Web Component Token</strong>: These tokens are generated by your
    backend services using the [Web Component Tokens
    API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Web-Component-Tokens/operation/CreateWebComponentToken).
    Each token can be scoped to perform a set number of actions and is active
    for 60 minutes. When creating a web component token for this specific
    component you'll need to use the role: `read:account:account_id` or
    `write:account:account_id`. Make sure the value for `account_id` matches the
    prop you also pass separately.
  </li>
</ul>
