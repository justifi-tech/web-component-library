Renders a form for collecting credit and debit card details as part of a checkout flow.

This component is **designed to be used within** the `justifi-checkout-wrapper` and **does not accept props directly**. Instead, it relies on shared state passed through the Stencil Store, managed by the wrapper component.

> **Note:** If you are using the card payment method, you also need to provide billing information. This can be done by using either the `justifi-billing-information-form` component or the `justifi-postal-code-form` component, or by passing the `billingInfo` object as an argument to the `submitCheckout` method called on the wrapper. The `billingInfo` object can contain all the fields or just the `address_postal_code` field.

```javascript
checkoutWrapper.submitCheckout({
  name: 'John Doe',;
  address_line1: '123 Main St',
  address_line2: 'Apt 4B', // Optional
  address_city:  'Springfield',
  address_state:  'IL', // Two-letter state code
  address_postal_code: '62701',
});

// or

checkoutWrapper.submitCheckout({
  address_postal_code: '62701',
});
```

**Authorization** and business context are also handled by `justifi-checkout-wrapper`, which manages authentication tokens and related configuration.

This component exposes **no public methods or properties** and is not intended for standalone use.
