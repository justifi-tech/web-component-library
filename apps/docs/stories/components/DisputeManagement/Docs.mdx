<h1>Authorization</h1>

<hr />

Web Component Token: These tokens are generated by your backend services using the [Web Component Tokens API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Web-Component-Tokens).
Each token can be scoped to perform a set number of actions and is active for 60 minutes.
When creating a web component token for this specific component you'll need to use the following roles:

<ul>
  <li>
    `Jake - what should these be?`
  </li>
</ul>

## Events usage

All table components emit an event when a row is clicked with the necessary information to call the appropriate `Details` component for that entity.
