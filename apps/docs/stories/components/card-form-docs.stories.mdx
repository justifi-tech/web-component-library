<Title />
Component to render the necessary fields to enter proper credit card information.

> **Note**: While it's possible to implement the **CardForm**, **BankAccountForm** and **BillingForm** individually - the **[PaymentForm](/docs/components-paymentform--docs)** is preferred as it combines the three components together and handles validating and passing data between them, and ultimately takes less implementation time. For most use-cases: the JustiFi Team officially recommends that developers choose the **[PaymentForm](/docs/components-paymentform--docs)** component when implementing components for payment processing.

# Props, events and methods

---

<ArgTypes exclude={["css-variables"]} />

# Styling

---

The `<justifi-card-form>` can be customized only through overriding `CSS variables`.

#### The full list of variables that can be overriden is listed in the [Introduction](/docs/introduction--docs#styling-components-with-variables).

# Authorization

---

Authorization can be performed by using a `client-id` or a `web-component-token`. Each option has its benefits and drawbacks.

- **Web-Component Token**: These tokens are generated by your backend services using the
  [Web-Component API](https://docs.justifi.tech/api-spec#tag/Web-Component-Tokens/operation/CreateWebComponentToken).
  Each token can be scoped to perform a set number of actions. These tokens are active for 24 hours.

- **Client-ID**: Your `client-id` is derived when you create a keypair in you JustiFi dashboard. Submitting the
  public `client-id` is a simpler integration for platforms because it does not require a secondary
  API request to generate a token. Additionally, the keypair can be rotated and deactivated in the JustiFi console.
  Using the `client-id` is only successful when completeing a request to tokenize a payment.
