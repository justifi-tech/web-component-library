<Title />
Component to render the necessary fields to enter proper credit card information.

> **Note**: While it's possible to implement the **CardForm**, **BankAccountForm** and **BillingForm** individually - the **[PaymentForm](/docs/components-paymentform--docs)** is preferred as it combines the three components together and handles validating and passing data between them, and ultimately takes less implementation time. For most use-cases: the JustiFi Team officially recommends that developers choose the **[PaymentForm](/docs/components-paymentform--docs)** component when implementing components for payment processing.
